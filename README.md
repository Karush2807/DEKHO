# 🚦 AI-Powered Adaptive Traffic Signal System

## 📌 Overvie
The **AI-Powered Adaptive Traffic Signal System** dynamically adjusts traffic signals based on real-time traffic conditions using **YOLOv8, OpenCV, and Reinforcement Learning (RL)**. This system prioritizes emergency vehicles, optimizes signal timing, and improves urban traffic flow.

## 🎯 Features
- **Real-Time Traffic Monitoring**: Uses CCTV cameras to detect vehicles and analyze congestion.
- **Adaptive Signal Control**: Dynamically adjusts signal durations based on real-time traffic data.
- **Emergency Vehicle Prioritization**: Identifies ambulances, fire trucks, and police vehicles for faster passage.
- **Reinforcement Learning-Based Optimization**: Continuously learns to improve signal efficiency.
- **Manual Override System**: Allows admin users to manually control signals via a dashboard.
- **Web-Based Dashboard**: Displays real-time traffic data and allows administrators to adjust settings.

##🚀 Getting Started

### **1️⃣Prerequisites**
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.9+** (For backend & AI models)
- **Node.js 18+** (For frontend)
- **Docker (Optional)** (For containerized deployment)

### **2️⃣Backend Setup**
#### **🔹Install Dependencies**
```sh
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### **🔹 Run Backend Server**
```sh
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### **3️⃣ Frontend Setup**
#### **🔹 Install Dependencies**
```sh
cd frontend
npm install
```

#### **🔹 Run Frontend Server**
```sh
npm run dev
```
Frontend will run on **`http://localhost:5173`**.

## 🧠 How It Works
### **🔍 Step 1: Vehicle Detection**
- Uses **YOLOv8 & OpenCV** to detect vehicles from CCTV camera feeds.

### **🚦 Step 2: Traffic Signal Adjustment**
- Dynamically adjusts signal durations based on real-time congestion.
- Uses **reinforcement learning** to improve over time.

### **🚑 Step 3: Emergency Vehicle Prioritization**
- Recognizes emergency vehicles using **RFID & Computer Vision**.
- Clears their path by adjusting traffic signals accordingly.

### **🖥️ Step 4: Web Dashboard**
- Displays live traffic data.
- Allows manual override for signal control.
